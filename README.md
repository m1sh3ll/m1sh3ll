<h3>About Me</h3>
I currently work in e-commerce with two clients that are Amazon private brands doing their listings/ads/design but am also a hobbyist programmer / hacker in my free time. You can view my Github repos that I have been accumulating for over the years! </p>

<h3>Coding/h3>
I currently only speak 3 main programming languages, that is, C#, VB .Net, and PHP. But I can basically translate any code such as Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, into pseudocode.
  
<h3>History</h3>
<p>Ever since I learned Visual Basic in high school around 1994 I was hooked on coding. It was either that or major in music. That's because I had a huge interest in playing rock guitar and listening to death metal. 

I built my first HTML web page in 1999 on AOL pages. In 2000, I ended up buying my own custom domain/email address for 80 bucks from Network Solutions and remember having a hacker friend host it for free from his house via his DSL. It was around then that I learned Unix, C Programming, and Shell Scripting through UMass online courses.  

My hacker friend who had really thick glasses (screen-name TheN4orcer) inspired me to learn Linux and networking since he had got a good paying job by hacking into his school at C.W. Post. So, I ended up going the wrong route and instead of going to school for web development in 2001, i went for Network Engineering instead (due to bad advice of an admissions instructor). 

I ended up starting my own e-commerce business and then working for friends doing their eBay and Amazon listings for low pay. It was then that I got to edit PHP templates and changed all the graphics without knowing anything but HTML. I had alot of friends who were mentors in everything from helping me a business to hosting my own websites.

<h3>Past Projects</h3>
Since 2003, I was a lazy programmer and since it was just a hobby, I only programmed desktop WinForms apps with Visual Basic 6 and .NET and more recently C#.  In the past I worked on a Cisco CCNA certification exam program with a MS Access file as a backend that I made with a graphic router simulator & flash cards, and sold the application on eBay regularly via installer CDs.
  
Nowadays, i had to relearn web development and full stack programming and now I am even more passionate about coding.
